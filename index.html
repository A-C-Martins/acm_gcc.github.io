                    To download and install a compiler for your C and C++ program, I advice you go to the offical
                    <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">Mingw site</a> or download <a href="https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/">Code::Block</a> editor which also comes with
                    an inbuilt GCC and GNU compiller. To download C and C++ <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC/GNU</a> compiler click on the link
                    below.
